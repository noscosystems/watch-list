  by [Mark Withall](http://www.markwithall.com/).

## Database (Model)

- [Entity Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/data/ef.aspx); an object-relational mapper that enables .NET
  developers to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. It eliminates the need for most of the
  data-access code that developers usually need to write.

## Design Pattern

### Model-View-ViewModel

- [Caliburn.Micro](http://caliburnmicro.com/); a small, yet powerful framework, designed for building applications
  across all XAML platforms. Its strong support for MV* patterns will enable you to build your solution quickly, without
  the need to sacrifice code quality or testability.
- [Microsoft Prism Library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430869.aspx); provides guidance designed to help
  you more easily design and build rich, flexible, and easily maintained Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) desktop
  applications. Fairly heavy-weight framework (note, use 4.1 to support .NET 4.0 and therefore XP).
- [MvvmCross](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross); provides a cross-platform MVVM mobile development framework. See
  [Sharing C# using MvvmCross](http://vimeo.com/68375201) by [Stuart Lodge](https://github.com/slodge).
- [MvvmLight](http://www.mvvmlight.net/); accelerate the creation and development of MVVM applications in WPF,
  Silverlight, Windows Store (RT) and for Windows Phone. Helps you to separate your View from your Model which creates
  applications that are cleaner and easier to maintain and extend. It also creates testable applications and allows you
  to have a much thinner user interface layer.
